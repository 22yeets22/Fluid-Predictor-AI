## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Required libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch

**Quick Start**  
- Run `test.py` as is to see the current model performance

### Usage
**Files Overview**  
- `constants.py` - Stores constants for training and testing.  
- `interactive.py` - Interactive tool for comparing real and AI simulations.  
- `test.py` - Tests AI performance with a generated starting position.  
- `train.py` - Trains a new model (adjust constants before running).  
- `visualize.py` - Displays simulation outputs without interaction.  
- `wave_simulation.py` - Core class for AI and base models.
